## What is ETL?
We are living in the world of data. The volume of data that is being generated and collected continues to increase at an exponential rate.
As the amount of data grows, the importance of making use of that data grows as well. This data is imssensly valuable for analytics, data science and machine learning, not only to present valuable information and noticable trends but also to derive business insights and predictions.
The data that is being captured and stored cannot be used in its raw form. Processing the raw, messy data into clean and reliable data is a critical step before it can be used for any analysyis. 
ETL, which stands for Ectract, Transform, and Load, is the process to extract data from various sources, transform the data into a clean, usable format, and load that data into various systems that end-users can access and use for further analysis, to make business desissions and solve problems.
